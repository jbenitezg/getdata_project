# getdata_project
The run_analysis.R script must be located at the same directory/structure level of the folder containing the training and test datasets.
This script will look for the original data set files and will generate the final tidy data.txt file containing the final dataset.
The script has been documented in a way that is very clear to understand, and explain each one of the steps followed to link data and write data, and also explain each process done to analyse the data. Have a look to the commented lines in run_analysis.R
Also have a look to the CodeBook.md file to see description of variables and data sets
